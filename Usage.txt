We currently have assigned identifiers with parent/child relationsips.  A child
may have multiple parents.  This has required a few modifications to remain useful.
For instance, so that University of California schools can identify departments,
we have assigned them a parent status, even though the "University of California
System" should really be the parent level.  Likewise, NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center is at a parent level, as are France's CNRS institutions.  Further work
on a schema to allow more complex relationships between institutions is under
develepment.

The solr fields in ADS that store the affiliation information are:

aff: raw affiliation string, tokenized

aff_id: a string containing one or more of the affiliation ids listed in
        the parent_child.tsv file in column "ADS_ids." 
        This field will soon also accept 9-digit ROR ids.

inst:   the abbreviated institution name (e.g. "U Adelaide") listed in the parent_child.tsv file




Examples:

aff:Harvard (81K)                 # returns any affiliation with Harvard, e.g. Harvard Street

aff:"Harvard University" (38K)    # returns affiliations containing the phrase "Harvard University"

aff_id:A00211 (12.7K)             # includes only records with Harvard University at the parent level

inst:"Harvard U" (59K)            # includes all strings that we have associated with Harvard University
                                    along with its children
